# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Deep Learning and LSTM

This project aims to detect credit card fraud using deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. The accompanying Jupyter Notebook (`project.ipynb`) provides a comprehensive overview of the implementation.

## Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant concern, and traditional methods may fall short in identifying sophisticated patterns. This project leverages the power of deep learning, focusing on LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its ability to capture sequential dependencies in data.

## Key Features

- **LSTM Architecture:** Utilizes LSTM neural networks to model and learn patterns in credit card transactions over time.
  
- **Fraud Detection:** Trains the model to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, enhancing accuracy in identifying anomalies.

## Learning Focus

This project serves as a valuable learning step for those interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) from scratch. By implementing LSTM, a foundational element in sequence modeling, users gain insights into the fundamentals of deep learning and its applications beyond text processing.

## Getting Started

To explore the project, simply open the https://github.com/pranavsrinivasa/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Model-using-LSTM/blob/main/credit-card-fraud-lstm.ipynb notebook and follow the step-by-step guide. The code is well-documented, making it accessible for both beginners and those looking to deepen their understanding of deep learning in the context of fraud detection.

Feel free to contribute, ask questions, or provide feedback to enhance the project further.
